One drawback with the phone is the front facing camera. LG just cheaped out on the front cam with just 5MP and is just satisfactory. As a sigh of relief, the dual cameras at the back are at another level. The pictures using the back cameras are sure clean and crisp.

Now they check my mobile and said there is one dent on mobile so they cannot replace it and they will not open and see my phone because they don't have parts of this mobile and it can take minimum 45 days.

The main reason why I had purchased this phone was because of camera, battery, performance and even the sound quality about this phone which I didn't expect would be so great. This phone fell from me more then 4 times and didn't had a small damage yet, thanks for the cover which they offer in the box. The beauty of this phone just kills the look of the other devices at this price range.
The camera of this phone is just like a beast.. you don't even have to touch the settings at all, it just uses its AI mode which you get the perfect picture what you don't even expect.
But the night mode of this device just turns the pic into real as you see with your naked eye. Mind-blowing...
I would recommend this phone to my friends who are looking at this price range.
Only the downside about this phone is the selfie camera. It just gives you very whitening of your face even though the beauty mode is turned off, which I seriously don't like, sometime it even comes blur.. Huawei needs to work on this.. rather everything his just perfect in this device.

I was using iOS since oast 9 years. The inly reason I sticked to iOS for son long is it's stability over the android. However, after seeing the features and advancement of android over iOS since past couple of years, I decided to switch it to Android. Just I had question about the hardware configuration. Hence, I wanted the best hardware configuration for my device which eliminate all the slowness possibilities for Android device.

About hardware:
The outer case is premium in feel and touch. The display ratio to body is perfect. You won't notice any borders as such on all corners. Display is pretty vivid and touch is suoer responsive. The device feels sturdy enough to handle small and medium impacts. The side buttons are easy to operate and does not feel too soft or too notchy either.

Camera:
Camera is not super but definitely a good one. There are lot of ootions in Pro mode just like we get un DSLR. You can set everything custom as per your requirement like focus, aperture, ISO, shutter soeed etc which eill results in very customisable photos.

Sound and Microphone:
Siund at loudspeakers are perfect and audible even in crowded places. Earpiece for calling fullfills the expectatios. Since Oneplus dies not provide the headphones in box, you can use any 3.5 mm headphones. I am using Apple earpods with thus device with no issues for music and calling and the music experience is not different than any iOS device.

Battery backup:
I simoly love the dadh charging technology of this device. It charges uoto 40 prr cent of battery just in 10 minutes. Overall battery backuo is upto the mark. A single charge will be sufficient with heavy internet usage for a day.

Overall performance:
Yes. This device does heats up a bit when you play any high end games for approx 30 minutes which is very natural as you are using all it's components at extereme levels for better gaming experience. But again, even the battery performance is suoerb for gaming too.

Few areas for improvement:
There are some areas in terms of user UI experience which Oneplus needs to improve a bit. Like other Android devices, this also keeps a lot of garbage files on you ROM which you need to clear time to time. Of course, it won't cause any slowness but it will definitely occupy a space on your ROM.

FINAL verdict:
I woukd definitely recommend this device because even other high end Android devices does not cone uo with such configuration at this orice tag. Snapdragon 845 with 640 GPU packed with 6/8 GB RAM is an astonishing combination in this price bucket.",4.6,4.3,4.3

I was wishing to get this phone when it was launched last year.
And after all the waiting i was got a chance to get this phone on 'INDEPENDENT DAY SALE'.
Guess what I got this phone @20605/- only with exchanged of my old MI MAX @12885/- and instant discount of 1500/- on SBI card.
I was so happy about that steal deal but little worried about the display, because i was using 'SAMSUNG A7 2017' which has a 'SUPER AMOLED' display and I know how AMOLED displays looks.
But when i hold this device on my hand first time and see the gorgeous POLED display man😍 it was just AWESOME and it looks like a AMOLED display.
The design is MIND BLOWING, BATTERY backup is also great even it has just 3300MAH battery.
Front camera is just 5mp which is disappointing
Rear camera's are great but only one thing is missing on camera department is 'PORTRAIT MODE' which is a trend of this day's.
And here is my question to LG why you don't give PORTRAIT MODE on your phone's? even I got 'OREO 8' update at that update they also forgot to give that mode.
Charger is really fast.⚡⚡⚡

161,Blackberry Evolve,47990,42990,"We'll this review is helpful for those who like physical keyboard. The best feature it has is its privacy and security. You can blindly trust on the blackberry security, why? Because that's what blackberry is all about. I use many accounts and I keep forgetting the parrwords at the same time I cannot trust third party apps to keep my passwords safe. But blackberry does provide a password keeper where I can manage my accounts passwords.

Coming to another security feature DTEK, if any app tries to use anything without my permission e.g. microphone it simply notified me about the access.

Locker: well if I want to hide anything in my phone I have 2 options. Either I use a third party app which again might secretly be stealing my personal photos and videos, which indeed is risky. Or I use locker by blackberry. It handles it all.

6gb ram is sufficient to take care of the speed of the phone. I've been using this phone for more than a month now and it has not lagged anywhere. Connected my Bluetooth earphones using NFC, helps me getting the best route while driving.

This phone is not for those who like playing heavy games. You won't get that full screen feel in this phone. But if you're really into typing and using lots of messaging apps throughout the day, this is the phone for you.

 Coming to camera, during my first week when I had not explored this phone properly I couldn't find the manual mode in the camera app which disappointed me a lot. But later on I found that manualode option and it was a jackpot for me. The Bokeh mode is too good. I actually clicked one photo in portrait mode with this phone and another one with iPhone 8 plus and the BlackBerry had the better clarity, provided the ambient light is sufficient, else iPhone will win, but at the same time iPhone is much costlier than this one like almost double it's cosr. Which isn't the deal breaker.

164,Honor View 10,35999,24999,"I was looking to buy a new phone, and then arrived Honor Play, and i made the mind to order it, and also ordered the 4gb/64gb variant, but the shipping was taking long, and then i had seen it on amazon in freedom sale, its price was 24999 and there was discount on SBI cards with no cost emi as well, so i compared it with honor play, and it was having same specs, with better camera. So i had gone for it, even without thinking about GPU Turbo, the main feature of Honor Play. And its been 2 months, and i am not regretting a single thing in it. It looks sexy, and i love it.

Now lets come to pros and cons

Pros:
1. Kirin 970, Huawei's flagship processor, pretty much capable of any task or game thrown to it, and i literally mean it, installed like 12 games including pubg, Asphalt 9, ark survival etc. And all runs smoothly(All still installed, and i play them alot)
2. 6gb ram/128gb enough for anything
3. 3750 mAH, easily gives 6-7 hours SOT, and easily manage to run for 1.5 days with basic chatting and surfing with always on data.
4. Display, it is nearly bezel-less, looks sexy
5. Cameras, both the cameras are awesome, loads of features(better then Honor Play, and compete neck to neck with Mi A2)
6. Fast charger, charges it within less then 90 mins from 0 to 100.

Cons:
1. EMUI, it is not optimized, lags/stutter here and there.

Verdict:
After recent update of GPU Turbo and AIS, and the last update of EIS, this phone has become true value for money(atleast for me, since i got it 23500 with no cost EMI ;) )
Go for it, if u still find it in 25k. It is a true flagship phone, with flagship features like NFC, flagship processor, good RAM and 128gb ROM.

P.S. adding a camera sample of its cover only, to show its camera quality.

179,HTC Desire 12,15900,9990,Best ever mobile I have seen this year.,,,
180,OnePlus 6,34999,29999,"Earlier, I was using a Samsung Galaxy J7 with 1.5 GB ram. To install and use a new app, one app needed to be deleted.
I have heard a lot about One Plus mobiles and decided to give it a shot. Glad I made the choice.

Things you get along with device is Dash Charger, screen-guard on the screen and a plastic cover.

The look and feel of the device are amazing. Midnight black comes with a classy matte finish. It is somewhat slippery to handle. The plastic cover is good for protection but if you don't like it you might need to spend 1-2k extra for a cover. I bought a sandstone cover for 1k and it looks good.

The one feature which sets this phone apart is the Dash Charger: 20 minutes is all it needs to get it charged for 30-40% and for about 30 minutes it will get to 60-75% which is more than enough.

Camera quality of this phone is comparable but not better than iPhone or other devices which costs at least 20k more than this. An image clicked by an experienced photographer from OnePlus can still beat a novice to intermediate photographer's iPhone pictures.

One another Feature you get is Face Unlock which is extremely fast and you will get addicted to it. It will be difficult to use other phones which cost lower than this because you will not want to slide or enter the pin or use the fingerprint scanner to unlock the device.

You will use anything and everything for this phone instead of your laptop or tablet.
I even booked a tatkal ticket on irctc while traveling in Bangalore traffic at 10:00 am!

If you are willing to spend 35-45k on a mobile which is not going to be obsolete in at least 2 years. You should opt for this model.

Some dilemma which people face:
6GB vs 8GB
Personally, I think 8GB should be preferable not for gaming but. We can't be sure whether 6 GB would be sufficient RAM after 2 years of time. I don't play mobile games but bought 8GB model just because 6GB might be normal after 2 years.

Space: 64GB vs 128GB vs 256GB

Provided that this model does not have an sd card slot, you will be stuck with whatever model you choose.
64GB is way too low for this phone because of a single recording or some pictures might take a couple of GB. Also, you get 52GB usable space which might not be sufficient. Hence you should either go with 128 or 256 variant.

128 is the most optimal choice and one should go for 256 only if following is the case:
1) You take a lot of pictures and videos, travel a lot, and don't believe in storing those in the cloud.
2) You watch tv shows and movies downloaded on your laptop and watch it on mobile.

Example:- My brother has a 64 GB variant of Samsung mobile, 2 complete courses from coursera and a couple of videos, photos that he clicked used 48-50 GB of storage space. (85-90% of available)
Amount:- 2 complete courses 200 video lectures and family video recording short clips
Whereas in my 256 GB model even if I have entire One Piece of 800 episodes i.e. 90-120GB it will still be around 50% of storage space.

You can spend extra 5-10k on storage once, but no matter what you do you can't expand the memory to 128 or 256 after you made the purchase. Hence I would recommend deciding accordingly which suits your requirement.

The only negative point is they could have included earphones with this but sadly they have not.

Overall:- I was satisfied with the purchase I made from Amazon Prime(which gave me the subscription to one-two day delivery in metro cities and Amazon video content)",4.6,4.3,4.3

The screen size is Handy but again if you are a large screen lover you have a wide range out there. For the people who are into purchasing this device i would personally be recommending you to purchase a case or cover along with phone as company doesn't gives you one in the box additionally the phone has a glass look at back so a cover or 360 protection is useful.",4.2,3.9,3.7
